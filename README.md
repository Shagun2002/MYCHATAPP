## Running the application

- Clone this repo to your local machine and open the project in an IDE Eclipse.
- Start the server by running the Server.java file and follow the prompt.
- Start the client by running the Client.java file.

Enter the same port number of the server when prompted on the client side.

Once connected to the server, you can start sending messages to other connected clients.
